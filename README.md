**PayPal API Clone - Middleware Service**

Welcome to the PayPal API Clone Middleware Service repository! This project replicates core functionalities of PayPalâ€™s API in a distributed system architecture. The middleware serves as the backbone for merchant interactions, enabling seamless modifications, authentication, and transaction tracking.

Overview
The Middleware Service is a critical component of this distributed system, providing merchants with tools to:

Modify transaction routing logic.
Authenticate themselves before interacting with the system.
Generate and manage API keys.
View and track transactions being processed.
Additional Components in the Ecosystem
This repository focuses on the Middleware Service, but the complete system includes:

Routing Service: Routes customer transaction requests to the appropriate services. 
Link to Roting Service (https://github.com/Amasaabu/router/tree/main)
Processor Service: Handles customer requests for processing transactions.
